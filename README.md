# Snake-Game
My first ever Java project published on GitHub. A Snake game with simple graphics made with Swing and AWT Graphics

## Things I am working on:
* Add a restart button (Broken, will push updates until I fix this issue)
* Add Sound
* Change the color of the Tiles
* Make the snake collide properly (Broken, will push updates until I fix this issue)
